# Diamond-Robot

The Diamond Robot is a specialized parallel robot designed for applications where precise control of the end-effector orientation is crucial.



In the `DiamondRobot.m` file you can find the robot modelization, planning and control using several techniques:
- Computed Torque
- Adaptive Computed Torque
- Backstepping
- Adaptive Backstepping
- Trace Control

The robotics dynamic equations have been obtained through the Denavit-Hartenberg robot parameterization.

The file `ScrewCalculusPro.m` contains a library used to obtain the robot kinematic and dynamic equations.
